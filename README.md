Petri Net Simulator for a Simplified MIPS Processor
===================================================

In this project we created a Petri Net simulator for a simplified MIPS Processor. The model will use colored tokens.  There are 8 Transitions and  three important places (instruction memory, register file, and data memory) of the Petri net model. All the arc carries (consumes) 1 token unless marked otherwise.

Following are the components of this project

Instruction Memory (INM)

Register File (RGF)

Data Memory (DAM)
